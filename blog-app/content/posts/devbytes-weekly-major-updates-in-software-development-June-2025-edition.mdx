Welcome to **DevBytes Weekly**, your quick and insightful roundup of the latest happenings in software development. Whether you're building microservices, deploying with Kubernetes, or exploring AI-powered tooling, this week's headlines have something for you.

## 🚀 1. GitHub Copilot Enterprise Adds Custom Knowledge Base Support

GitHub has just rolled out a powerful new feature for Copilot Enterprise: **custom knowledge base integration**. This means teams can now feed internal docs, code conventions, and API specs directly into Copilot's context—turning it into a highly specialized assistant.

### 🔧 Why It Matters

- Reduces onboarding time for new devs
- Improves code consistency across large orgs
- Brings internal documentation to life in your editor

> “It's like having a senior engineer whispering team best practices in your ear,” one early adopter said.

## 📦 2. Docker Announces Native AI Container Scanning

Docker Desktop 5.3 (released June 2025) introduces **AI-powered vulnerability detection** that analyzes not just images, but your containerized app’s behavior during runtime simulations.

### 📊 Key Features

- Detects configuration risks in `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- Suggests optimized base images
- Flags dependencies with active exploits based on real-world behavior

Security teams are calling it a "shift-left game-changer."

## 🌐 3. WebAssembly (Wasm) Hits Mainstream with Firefox & Chrome Performance Boosts

Both Mozilla and Google announced **major performance enhancements** to their JavaScript engines’ support for WebAssembly (Wasm), closing the performance gap with native apps by up to **30%**.

### 🎯 Impact

- More desktop-level apps in the browser (think Photoshop, Figma, games)
- Faster execution of compiled languages like Rust, C++, and Go on the web
- Increased adoption in edge computing environments

Wasm is no longer a toy. It's production-ready.

## 🧠 4. VS Code’s New “Code Context Navigator” Uses AI to Understand Projects

The latest Visual Studio Code update includes a feature called **Code Context Navigator**. It uses lightweight machine learning to map out project structure, track function flow, and even visualize coupling between modules.

### ⚡ Features

- Interactive graph of dependencies
- Natural language search like “show me where auth is handled”
- Integrates with GitHub Issues to show affected files

Developers are calling it “GPS for your codebase.”

## 🌍 5. Open Dev Foundation Launches OpenAPI 4.0 Draft

The Open Dev Foundation released the draft for **OpenAPI 4.0**, aiming to modernize RESTful API documentation for today’s polyglot, serverless, and asynchronous environments.

### 🚧 What’s New

- Built-in async API support (WebSockets, SSE)
- Schema-first contract negotiation
- Improved support for multi-protocol APIs

Tooling updates expected later this year.

## 🧵 Quick Hits

- 🧪 **Jest 30** adds snapshot streaming for faster test runs
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL 17 Beta** improves JSONB performance by \~20%
- 🛠️ **Netlify Edge Functions** now support Python natively
- 🧱 **Bun** (JavaScript runtime) reaches 1.5 with full ESM support
